        I'm a technology leader, software developer, and maker. I currently work as a
        Chief Product & Technology Officer, where I lead product and engineering teams
        to build things that matter.
      </p>

      <h2>The short version</h2>

      <p>
        I grew up fascinated by how things work — especially computers. That curiosity
        led me to study Computer Science, which turned into a career building software,
        leading teams, and shaping products. Along the way, I've been a developer, an
        architect, a manager, and now a CPTO.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I'm into music, art, exercise, and anything that lets me
        create or learn something new.
      </p>

      <h2>The longer version</h2>

      <p>
        My first real encounter with programming was writing HTML in Notepad as a
        teenager, trying to make the ugliest possible website (and succeeding). From
        there it was a straight line through to studying Computer Science at university,
        where I discovered that I loved not just building things, but figuring out
        <em>how</em> to build them well.
      </p>

      <p>
        After university, I started as a software engineer and worked my way through
        increasingly complex systems and larger teams. I learned that the hardest
        problems in technology are rarely technical — they're about people,
        communication, and making good decisions under uncertainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        That realisation led me toward leadership. As a CPTO, I get to combine the
        things I love most: technical depth, product thinking, and building teams where
        people can do their best work.
      </p>

      <h2>What I care about</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clean code and architecture</strong> — because complexity is the enemy</li>
        <li><strong>Developer experience</strong> — tools and processes should help, not hinder</li>
        <li><strong>Shipping</strong> — the best plans are worthless without execution</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous learning</strong> — the day I stop learning is the day I retire</li>
        <li><strong>Music</strong> — listening, discovering, sometimes making</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise</strong> — the body runs the mind</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>This site</h2>

      <p>
        I built this site because I wanted a home on the web that wasn't someone else's
        platform. It's a place to write, share projects, and think out loud. If
        something here resonates with you, <a href="/links/">get in touch</a>.
