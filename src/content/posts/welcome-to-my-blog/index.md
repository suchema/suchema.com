This is my first post. Welcome.

I've been meaning to set up a proper personal space on the web for years now. Not a LinkedIn profile, not a Twitter feed — an actual *place* where I can write long-form, share projects, and think out loud.

## What to expect

This blog will be a mix of whatever I'm interested in at any given moment:

- **Technology** — architecture decisions, engineering leadership, things I'm learning
- **Music** — what I'm listening to, making, or thinking about
- **Art & Design** — visual inspiration and creative projects
- **Exercise & Wellbeing** — because the body runs the mind
- **Work & Leadership** — the human side of building products and teams

## The tech stack

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a static site generator that ships zero JavaScript by default. The content lives in Markdown files. The typography uses Newsreader (serif) and Inter (sans-serif), self-hosted for speed and privacy.

It's fast, simple, and — most importantly — it gets out of the way so I can focus on writing.

More soon.
